<h1>Composing a cantus firmus</h1>

<p>Exercises in strict voice-leading, or species counterpoint, begin with a single, well formed musical line called the <em>cantus firmus</em> (fixed voice, or fixed melody; pl. <em>cantus firmi</em>). Our first exercises in strict voice-leading will be to compose a good <em>cantus firmus</em>.</p>

<p>The first step is to sing and analyze model <em>cantus firmi</em>. A number of them are provided <a href="Graphics/counterpoint/cantusFirmi.pdf">here</a>. (These models will also be used as the starting points for our two-voice exercises.)</p>

<p>From these <em>cantus</em>, notice the following general characteristics, which are typical of all well formed <em>cantus firmi</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>length of about 8–16 notes</li>
<li>arhythmic (all whole notes; no long or short notes)</li>
<li>begin and end on <em>do</em></li>
<li>approach final tonic by step (usually <em>re</em>–<em>do</em>, sometimes <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em>)</li>
<li>all note-to-note progressions are melodic consonances</li>
<li>range (interval between lowest and highest notes) of no more than a tenth, usually less than an octave</li>
<li>a single climax (high point) that appears only once in the melody</li>
<li>clear logical connection and smooth shape from beginning to climax to ending</li>
<li>mostly stepwise motion, but with some leaps (mostly small leaps)</li>
<li>no repetition of "motives" or "licks"</li>
<li>any large leaps (fourth or larger) are followed by step in opposite direction</li>
<li>no more than two leaps in a row; no consecutive leaps in the same direction</li>
<li>the leading tone progresses to the tonic</li>
<li>in minor, the leading tone only appears in the penultimate bar; the raised submediant is only used when progressing to that leading tone</li>
</ul>
