<h1>Minuet form</h1>

<h1>Formal containers in the classical minuet</h1>

<p>A classical minuet movement typically contains a <em>main minuet</em>, followed by a <em>trio</em> that is very similar in structure with a minuet, followed by a <em>da capo</em> repeat of the main minuet (usually performed without taking the repeats). The movement, then, has a large-scale ABA' form: <em>minuet–trio–minuet da capo</em>.</p>

<p>Both the main minuet and the trio tend to be <em>small ternary</em> structures. Like the minuet/trio movement, the small ternary form follows an ABA' structure. However, the small ternary structure found in the typical minuet is of the <em>rounded binary</em> type. That is, while there are three distinct parts—A, B, and A'—they are grouped into two larger sections, each of which is repeated.</p>

<p>The first part in the two-part structure is the <em>first reprise</em>, and the second part is the <em>second reprise</em>, so called because they each repeat. The first reprise contains the A section of the minuet; the second contains the B and the A' sections.</p>

<blockquote><p>||: A :||: B A' :||</p></blockquote>

<p>When listening to the minuet, the three parts of the small ternary structure are heard in the order:</p>

<blockquote><p>A A B A' B A'</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, the minuet form has properties both of ternary or three-part form (three distinct sections: A, B, A') and binary or two-part form (two reprises).</p>

<h1>Formal functions in the classical minuet</h1>

<p>Each container in the minuet's (or the trio's) small ternary form has its own formal function attached to it. The formal function exhibited in the A section is called <em>exposition</em> function; the B section <em>contrasting middle</em> function; and the A' section <em>recapitulation</em> function. As with all formal functions, each of these functions have <em>internal characteristics</em> that define and identify it as well as a <em>position within the larger formal structure</em> that define it.</p>

<h2>Exposition</h2>

<p>The definitive internal characteristics of <em>exposition</em> function are the presence of a <em>characteristic melodic theme</em> that will define and identify the minuet, the <em>establishment of the home key</em>, and <em>movement toward a secondary key</em>. The characteristic melodic theme is typically a <em>period</em> or <em>hybrid 1</em> (antecedent + continuation), though it may also be a sentence or another hybrid type. In a typical exposition containing a period or hybrid 1, the home key is established by a cadence in the home key—usually a I:HC—at the end of the antecedent phrase. (A sentence would establish the home key through tonic prolongation in the presentation phrase.) Movement toward a secondary key takes place in a continuation or consequent phrase, ending almost always with a V:PAC (when coming from a major home key) or a III:PAC (minor home key). A <em>modulating Prinner</em> schema is often used in a continuation phrase modulating to V. Harmonic sequences are also common means of moving to the new key.</p>

<blockquote><p>Major-key exposition:<br/>
phrase 1: Antecedent → I:HC<br/>
phrase 2: Consequent/continuation → V:PAC</p>

<p>Minor-key exposition:<br/>
phrase 1: Antecedent → I:HC<br/>
phrase 2: Consequent/continuation → III:PAC</p></blockquote>

<p>The definitive position of exposition function is at the beginning of a small ternary form (A section, beginning of the minuet or beginning of the trio). When a minuet or trio begins, expect the above internal characteristics to be present, and listen for any deviations from those norms.</p>

<p>When listening to a minuet to identify whether or not a passage exhibits <em>exhibition</em> function, first keep in mind simply that minuets rarely begin with a function other than exposition. If you are listening to a passage without knowing where the passage occurs in the movement, listen for a single tight-knit theme that ends with a V:PAC or III:PAC. If you are unsure about the modulation, use the repeat of the A secion to determine whether the A section begins in the same key in which it ends. Classical minuets are highly conventional forms, and there are rarely exposition modulations other than I-to-V in major or I-to-III in minor.</p>

<h2>Contrasting middle</h2>

<p>The definitive internal characteristics of <em>contrasting middle</em> function are a <em>return to the home key</em> culminating in a I:HC or a <em>dominant arrival</em> in the home key, and a likely looser-knit structure than found in exposition or recapitulation functions. The return to the home key is often, though not always, accomplished by a <em>Fonte</em>, <em>Monte</em>, or <em>Ponte</em> schema, or some combination of those schemas, beginning immediately after the end of the A section/first reprise. Tighter-knit B sections are almost always <em>sentences</em>, beginning with a two-bar basic idea that is repeated a step higher (<em>Monte</em>) or a step lower (<em>Fonte</em>).</p>

<p>The definitive position of <em>contrasting middle</em> function is immediately following <em>exposition function</em> at the beginning of the second reprise (B section in a small ternary). If you lose track of the boundary between the A and B sections, listen for the repeat of the second reprise, which will go back to the beginning of the B section.</p>

<h2>Recapitulation</h2>

<p>The definitive internal characteristics of <em>recapitulation</em> function are the <em>return of the basic idea</em> from the A section at the beginning of the recapitulation, the <em>return of the home key</em> at the beginning of the recapitulation, and a final cadence in the home key—I:PAC. In a typical small ternary, the antecedent phrases that open A and A' are identical or nearly so. If a <em>modulating Prinner</em> was used in the A section's continuation phrase to modulate to V, a non-modulating Prinner will be used in the A' section's continuation phrase to prepare the final I:PAC.</p>

<p>The definitive position of <em>recapitulation</em> function is at the end of the second reprise, immediately following <em>contrasting middle</em> function (and preceding the repeat of the <em>contrasting middle</em> function when the entire second reprise is repeated).</p>
