<h1>Keyboard-style voice-leading schemata</h1>

<p>Following are a number of <em>schemata</em> for keyboard-style voice-leading. Some of these are patterns that are common enough to warrant special attention (and memorization). Others require non-default voice-leading or doublings. In any case, these are worth memorizing to assist both in composition/arranging and in recognition of standard patterns.</p>

<h2>Voice exchange</h2>

<p>A <em>voice exchange</em> occurs when the melody and bass lines exchange pitches over the course of a simple contrapuntal prolongation. For example, in the progression <strong>T(1 D2p 3)</strong>, the bass begins on <em>do</em> and ends on <em>mi</em>. In a voice exchange, the melody would reverse this, starting on <em>mi</em> and ending on <em>do</em>. This common pattern can use either a 6/4 or a 6/3 chord for <strong>D2p</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/VE63.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using this voice exchange pattern will ensure smooth voice-leading throughout the prolongation.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>fa</em> in the <strong>D2p</strong> chord of the second example does <em>not</em> resolve down to <em>mi</em>. This is permissible because <em>mi</em> is required of the bass line, and because the smooth outer-voice counterpoint and stepwise inner-voice motion counteract any harshness perceived by the unresolved dissonance.</p>

<p>The voice exchange can also be used with a <strong>D4i</strong> chord. Note that the upper voices will be exactly the same as with a 6/4 <strong>D2p</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/D4i.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These patterns can be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and the <strong>D2p</strong> voice exchanges can be used in reverse, as well—<strong>T(3 D2p 1)</strong>. They can also be used to prolong S and D: <strong>S(4 T5p 6)</strong> or <strong>D(5 S6p 7)</strong>, for example.</p>

<h2>Parallel tenths</h2>

<p><em>Do–re–mi</em> in the bass can also be accompanied by <em>mi–fa–sol</em> in the melody, making <em>parallel tenths</em>.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/ParallelTenths.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note here that, like the <em>fa</em> in the <strong>D2p</strong> voice exchange, the <em>fa</em> in the melody is an unresolved functional dissonance. In this case, the voice leading once again is so smooth that it overrides the need for the functional dissonance to resolve.</p>

<p>This pattern can also be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and in reverse.</p>

<h2>Champagne progression</h2>

<p>While <strong>T(1 D2p 3)</strong> is a perfectly acceptable way to accompany <em>mi–fa–sol</em> in the melody, a more interesting (and also more involved) way to harmonize that melody is what my undergraduate theory professor, Gene Biringer, called the <em>champagne progression</em>: <strong>T(1 S6d 3)</strong>. (It's the progression you use when you want to impress a date.)</p>

<p>The champagne progression is very nice, but must be treated carefully. <em>Only</em> use it with <em>mi–fa–sol</em> (or <em>me–fa–sol</em>) in the melody, and <em>always</em> use the following voice-leading (note the non-standard doubling of the bass—<em>la</em>/<em>le</em>—in the <strong>S6d</strong> chord).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/Champagne.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The standard champagne progression (above) uses a 6/3 chord for <strong>T3</strong>. Following is a variant using 5/3 for <strong>T3</strong>, which Biringer dubbed "pink champagne," because it is especially nice. It should also be especially <em>rare</em>, or it loses its punch.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/PinkChampagne.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The champagne progression should only be used to prolong tonic function.</p>

<h2>Deceptive resolution</h2>

<p>A <em>deceptive resolution</em> occurs When a <strong>D5</strong> chord does not progress, as expected, to a <strong>T1</strong> to form an authentic cadence, but instead progresses to <strong>Tx6</strong>. In the deceptive resolution, it is important for <em>ti</em> to resolve to <em>do</em>—as it would in an authentic cadence—not <em>la</em>/<em>le</em>. This fulfills its role as a tendency tone, helps the "deception" to work, and avoids the dissonant augmented second <em>ti</em>–<em>le</em> in minor. This results in a non-standard doubling.</p>

<p>In a deceptive resolution, always double <em>do</em> in the Tx6 chord, <em>not</em> the bass.</p>

<h2>Leaving out the fifth</h2>

<p>When <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em> appears in the melody of an authentic cadence, and the <strong>D5</strong> chord takes a seventh, it is impossible to fully voice both chords <em>and</em> resolve the functional dissonance.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/D5problem.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is imperative to resolve this functional dissonance. In order to do so, either leave out the fifth of the <strong>T1</strong> chord (and triple the bass):</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/T1dropFifth.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>or leave out the fifth of the <strong>D5</strong> chord, and double the bass:</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/D5dropFifth.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The incomplete <strong>D5</strong> is preferable to the incomplete <strong>T1</strong>, but voice-leading into the <strong>D5</strong> should dictate which option you choose.</p>

<h2>Leaving out the third</h2>

<p>When an <strong>S4</strong> progresses into a <strong>D5</strong>, and both are <em>seventh chords</em>, it can be impossible to prepare and resolve the functional dissonances of both chords while fully voicing them.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/S4problem.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead, leave out the third above the bass of the <strong>S4</strong> chord—<em>la</em>/<em>le</em>—and double the bass. This will retain the trigger and bass note <em>fa</em>, as well as the two pitches making the dissonance, and will allow a second <em>fa</em> in an upper voice that can prepare the seventh of the <strong>D5</strong> chord.</p>

<h2>Double-neighbor prolongation</h2>

<p>The <em>double-neighbor</em> prolongation of tonic poses no problems for voice-leading. However, it is important to note that <strong>T(1 D(2 7)n 1)</strong> is far more common than <strong>T(1 D(7 2)n 1)</strong>.</p>

<h2>Plagal progressions</h2>

<p>As a rule, <strong>T</strong> is used for contrapuntal prolongation of <strong>S</strong>, <strong>S</strong> prolongs <strong>D</strong>, and <strong>D</strong> prolongs <strong>T</strong>. However, there are some common patterns in which <strong>S</strong> is used to prolong <strong>D</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>champagne progression</em> is one, which has been described above. Another is the <strong>S4d</strong>, as well as the related <strong>S4e</strong>—both described in the harmonic syntax resource.</p>

<p>One other common figure is to use <strong>S4</strong> as a complete or incomplete neighbor to <strong>T3</strong>. Common progressions include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>T(1 S4i 3)</strong></li>
<li><strong>T(3 S4n 3)</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Also common is a <em>change-of-figure</em> prolongation of <strong>T1</strong>: 5/3 to 6/4 to 5/3. The 6/4 chord (<em>fa</em>–<em>la</em>/<em>le</em>–<em>do</em>) can be considered an <strong>S</strong> chord, but it is more appropriate simply to consider the sixth and fourth above the bass in that chord to be neighbor tones to the fifth and third. Simply label such a progression <strong>T1——</strong>.</p>
