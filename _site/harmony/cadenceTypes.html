<p>A <em>cadence</em> is a point of arrival that punctuates the end of a musical unit, such as a phrase, theme, large formal section, or movement. A cadence is at once a harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and formal event, but cadences tend to be grouped according to different ways in which harmony and melody articulate that point of arrival.</p>

<h1>Authentic and half cadences</h1>

<p>These unit-ending points of arrival are first grouped into <em>authentic cadences</em> and <em>half cadences</em>. An authentic cadence occurs when a formal unit ends with the progression <strong>D5–T1</strong> (<em>sol</em> to <em>do</em> in the bass voice). If the melody accompanying this harmonic progression ends on <em>do</em>, it is called a <em>perfect authentic cadence</em>; it the melody ends on <em>mi</em> or <em>me</em> (or more rarely <em>sol</em>), it is called an <em>imperfect authentic cadence</em>.</p>

<p>Phrases that end on <strong>D5</strong> without progressing to <strong>T1</strong> are called <em>half cadences</em>. These cadences typically contain <em>re</em> in the melody, though <em>ti</em> and <em>sol</em> are also possible points of melodic arrival. The <strong>D5</strong> is almost invariably a triad (5/3), rather than a seventh chord.</p>

<p>Differentiating between <em>perfect authentic cadences</em> (PAC), <em>imperfect authentic cadences</em> (IAC), and <em>half cadences</em> (HC) by ear and with a score is essential both to formal analysis and model composition.</p>

<h1>Simple, compound, and double cadences</h1>

<p>Writers of Italian keyboard treatises like <a href="http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Furno/regoleP5.htm">Furno</a> and <a href="http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Fenaroli/Regole/regoleP3.htm">Fenaroli</a> (and, more recently, American historical theorists like <a href="http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/index.htm">Robert O. Gjerdingen</a>) differentiate cadences according to the voice-leading found over the dominant harmony. These distinctions do not replace the above PAC/IAC/HC distinctions; rather they add another level of detail that is particularly helpful in model composition. These voice-leading distinctions provide three more cadence categories to complement PAC, IAC, and HC: the <em>simple cadence</em>, the <em>compound cadence</em>, and the <em>double cadence</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>simple cadence</em> occurs when the dominant harmonic function is articulated by a single chord—either a triad or a seventh chord. The simple cadence can be used in a PAC, IAC, or HC construction, though the seventh-chord version is typically only found in authentic cadences.</p>

<p>A <em>compound cadence</em> occurs when the bass note <em>sol</em> of the cadential dominant is repeated, often with the second <em>sol</em> an octave lower than the first. The compound cadence comes in three specific forms.</p>

<p>The first type of compound cadence involves a 4–3 suspension—<em>do</em> to <em>ti</em>—over the <em>sol</em> bass of the D5 harmony. In a four-voice texture, the other two voices sustain a fifth above the bass and an octave above the bass. The <em>thoroughbass</em> figure is typically the abbreviated 4–3, which stands for 8/5/4–8/5/3 in four voices. The 4–3 suspension can occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.</p>

<p>The second type of compound cadence adds a <em>mi/me</em> to <em>re</em> voice (6–5) to the above 4–3 suspension. In a four-voice texture, the bass is doubled. The typical thoroughbass figure is 6/4–5/3, leading to the common name for this progression, the <em>cadential six-four</em>. The complete figure is 8/6/4–8/5/3.  The cadential six-four can occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.</p>

<p>The last type of compound cadence is a special case of the cadential six-four, where the fourth voice introduces a seventh over the second dominant chord, rather than simply doubling the bass for both chords. This compound cadence type requires four voices and complete thoroughbass figures of 8/6/4–7/5/3. This figure rarely occurs over the dominant of a half cadence and is instead reserved primarily for authentic cadences.</p>

<p>A <em>double cadence</em> is a four-stage pattern over the cadential dominant used almost exclusively in perfect authentic cadences. Though it had expired from common use by the time of Mozart and Haydn, it was a staple for earlier <em>galant</em> composers and <em>Classical</em> treatises on composition and accompaniment. The four-stage pattern over the dominant is 5/3–6/4–5/4–5/3. In four voices, the bass is also doubled, or a seventh can be applied to any <em>chord of the fifth</em> (i.e., not the 6/4).</p>
