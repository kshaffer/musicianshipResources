# Formal containers in the classical minuet #

A classical minuet movement typically contains a *main minuet*, followed by a *trio* that is very similar in structure with a minuet, followed by a *da capo* repeat of the main minuet (usually performed without taking the repeats). The movement, then, has a large-scale ABA' form: *minuet–trio–minuet da capo*.

Both the main minuet and the trio tend to be *small ternary* structures. Like the minuet/trio movement, the small ternary form follows an ABA' structure. However, the small ternary structure found in the typical minuet is of the *rounded binary* type. That is, while there are three distinct parts—A, B, and A'—they are grouped into two larger sections, each of which is repeated. 

The first part in the two-part structure is the *first reprise*, and the second part is the *second reprise*, so called because they each repeat. The first reprise contains the A section of the minuet; the second contains the B and the A' sections.

> ||: A :||: B A' :||

When listening to the minuet, the three parts of the small ternary structure are heard in the order:

> A A B A' B A' 

Thus, the minuet form has properties both of ternary or three-part form (three distinct sections: A, B, A') and binary or two-part form (two reprises).

# Formal functions in the classical minuet #

Each container in the minuet's (or the trio's) small ternary form has its own formal function attached to it. The formal function exhibited in the A section is called *exposition* function; the B section *contrasting middle* function; and the A' section *recapitulation* function. As with all formal functions, each of these functions have *internal characteristics* that define and identify it as well as a *position within the larger formal structure* that define it.

## Exposition ##

The definitive internal characteristics of *exposition* function are the presence of a *characteristic melodic theme* that will define and identify the minuet, the *establishment of the home key*, and *movement toward a secondary key*. The characteristic melodic theme is typically a *period* or *hybrid 1* (antecedent + continuation), though it may also be a sentence or another hybrid type. In a typical exposition containing a period or hybrid 1, the home key is established by a cadence in the home key—usually a I:HC—at the end of the antecedent phrase. (A sentence would establish the home key through tonic prolongation in the presentation phrase.) Movement toward a secondary key takes place in a continuation or consequent phrase, ending almost always with a V:PAC (when coming from a major home key) or a III:PAC (minor home key). A *modulating Prinner* schema is often used in a continuation phrase modulating to V. Harmonic sequences are also common means of moving to the new key.

> Major-key exposition:  
phrase 1: Antecedent → I:HC  
phrase 2: Consequent/continuation → V:PAC

> Minor-key exposition:  
phrase 1: Antecedent → I:HC  
phrase 2: Consequent/continuation → III:PAC

The definitive position of exposition function is at the beginning of a small ternary form (A section, beginning of the minuet or beginning of the trio). When a minuet or trio begins, expect the above internal characteristics to be present, and listen for any deviations from those norms.

When listening to a minuet to identify whether or not a passage exhibits *exhibition* function, first keep in mind simply that minuets rarely begin with a function other than exposition. If you are listening to a passage without knowing where the passage occurs in the movement, listen for a single tight-knit theme that ends with a V:PAC or III:PAC. If you are unsure about the modulation, use the repeat of the A secion to determine whether the A section begins in the same key in which it ends. Classical minuets are highly conventional forms, and there are rarely exposition modulations other than I-to-V in major or I-to-III in minor.

## Contrasting middle ##

The definitive internal characteristics of *contrasting middle* function are a *return to the home key* culminating in a I:HC or a *dominant arrival* in the home key, and a likely looser-knit structure than found in exposition or recapitulation functions. The return to the home key is often, though not always, accomplished by a *Fonte*, *Monte*, or *Ponte* schema, or some combination of those schemas, beginning immediately after the end of the A section/first reprise. Tighter-knit B sections are almost always *sentences*, beginning with a two-bar basic idea that is repeated a step higher (*Monte*) or a step lower (*Fonte*).

The definitive position of *contrasting middle* function is immediately following *exposition function* at the beginning of the second reprise (B section in a small ternary). If you lose track of the boundary between the A and B sections, listen for the repeat of the second reprise, which will go back to the beginning of the B section.

## Recapitulation ##

The definitive internal characteristics of *recapitulation* function are the *return of the basic idea* from the A section at the beginning of the recapitulation, the *return of the home key* at the beginning of the recapitulation, and a final cadence in the home key—I:PAC. In a typical small ternary, the antecedent phrases that open A and A' are identical or nearly so. If a *modulating Prinner* was used in the A section's continuation phrase to modulate to V, a non-modulating Prinner will be used in the A' section's continuation phrase to prepare the final I:PAC.

The definitive position of *recapitulation* function is at the end of the second reprise, immediately following *contrasting middle* function (and preceding the repeat of the *contrasting middle* function when the entire second reprise is repeated).
